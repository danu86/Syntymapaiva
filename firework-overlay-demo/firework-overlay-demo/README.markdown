# Firework Overlay Demo

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/NevqWJ](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/pen/NevqWJ).

This is a fork of my [firework simulator](https://codepen.io/MillerTime/full/XgpNwb) that shows how it could be used as an overlay above custom content. Keep in mind I built this as a standalone project, not as a plugin/library. There are a bunch of issues you may possibly run into using this code.

Some features from the full version have been disabled, including sound effects and the menu system. Getting these to work well on a custom site involves even more work.

If you like this and use it yourself, I would appreciate if you credit me (Caleb Miller) at [cmiller.tech](https://cmiller.tech).
